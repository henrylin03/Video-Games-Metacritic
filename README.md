# Video Games Metacritic: Data Analysis
## Description
In this project, I analyse data of video games released from 1995 to 2021. 

I used Python (`pandas`) to load the data into Jupyter Notebooks, and used SQL (`sqlite`) to inspect and clean the data, then query for insights. 

## How to Use the Project
Please see the following steps:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code.
3. Run all cells to see queried tables.

## Credits
The dataset was hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor/top-video-games-19952021-metacritic), which was scraped then shared by Deep Contractor.
